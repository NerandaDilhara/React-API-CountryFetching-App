# üåç React Countries Explorer

## Overview

React Countries Explorer is a modern, responsive web application that allows users to discover and explore detailed information about countries from all around the world. Built with **React** using the **Vite** build tool, and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, this application leverages the public [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to provide real-time, up-to-date information.

The app demonstrates best practices in React development, including the use of functional components, dynamic routing, API integration, responsive UI design, and clean code organization. It's perfect as a learning project for those who want to strengthen their frontend development skills and understand how to work with external APIs.
